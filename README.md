# CALENDER

This HTML and CSS code creates a visually appealing calendar display with current date, month, and day. The calendar is styled using CSS for layout, colors, and alignment. JavaScript dynamically updates the date, month, and day elements. Additionally, a footer with a copyright notice is included at the bottom of the page.
